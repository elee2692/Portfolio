  <p>Besides literal food, I think one of the most important lessons that I've learned in life is that life is fleeting. Time is the most precious thing known to mankind. She doesn't care about politics or money, she does what she wants and she's consistent. I know this rising 8th grader at my school who got hit by a train in a freak accident. Unfortunately she didn't survive, and it just made me think about all the people's lives her death affected, and how you never know when time is going to run out on you. Time isn't biased and does as she wishes. As scary as it sounds I think it is a beautiful phenomenon-to possess something that is so priceless and limited. I mean after all, that's how our capitalist society works. Whatever makes the money, am I right? I think it is beautiful that people are able to decide what they want to do with their time while they are still alive. Most people's mentality or goal is to do as much as possible and to not second guess yourself but I think there is also respect, poise, and power in letting people do what they want with their time whether it is to contemplate, or to act. Find a middle ground, whatever works for you. Take life as fast or slow as you want.
